# Instructions  
If you head over to Replit, you will find a partially written program for this assignment.Your job is to complete the program. When it is complete, the program will ask the user to enter the width and length of a rectangle and then display the rectangle’s area. The program calls the following functions, which have not been written:

• getLength – This function should ask the user to enter the rectangle’s length and then return that value as a double .

• getWidth – This function should ask the user to enter the rectangle’s width and then return that value as a double .

• getArea – This function should accept the rectangle’s length and width as arguments and return the rectangle’s area. The area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width.

• displayData – This function should accept the rectangle’s length, width, and area as arguments and display them in an appropriate message on the screen.

Submit your code in Replit and submit this assignment to let me know you are done.
